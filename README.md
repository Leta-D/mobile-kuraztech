Hello am Leta Dejene 3rd year software engeneering student at ASTU  

this is a Simple Task Manager App  

I created this project as an internship program competition task  

# Tools and frameWorks  
I used Flutter as a framework  

provider for state management  
sharedPreferances for storing simple tasks  

# App features  

  Add task  
  
  Delete task  
  
  Complete task  
  
  Show completed task on separate page  
  
  Calculate percentage of completed from total  
  
  Automaticaly update when task deleted (provider helps me handle this)  
  
  Don't allow repeated tasks (it shows the app already exists on the UI)  
  
  A login page (this page is just for demo it allows any one to enter with any password)
